# VR-Journalism-Project

## Description

## Technical Specifications

### Git

When contributing to the project you must make sure to fetch every single time using whatever method of source control you use.

### Unity

When making changes always make changes to your own scenes, this way there is a reduction of merge conflicts. THAT MEANS DONT TOUCH THE MAIN SCENE! Another way to prevent merge conflicts is to have things in prefabs.
