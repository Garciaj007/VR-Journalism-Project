## Technical Instructions

### Git

When contributing to the project you must make sure to fetch every single time using whatever method of source control you use.

#### Initial Setup

After your first pull please make sure to download and import the packages from the Package Manager. Unity's console should tell you what you need to load in the project.

#### Import Media

Also be sure to download and import the media folder. Which should be structured as...

Assets -> Media : download all the images & videos from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mg7j1BqTlZJ6SZx6-2vQ6vD2C_bu4B9a "Gore Park, Climate Change Protest ")

### Unity

When making changes always make changes to your own scenes, this way there is a reduction of merge conflicts. **THAT MEANS DONT TOUCH THE MAIN SCENE!** Another way to prevent merge conflicts is to have things in prefabs.
